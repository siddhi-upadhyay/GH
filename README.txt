The implementation of NoC is done in AMD Vivado software.

I have added all the files to demonstrate the test results.
The approach is explained in the pdf to get better performance results. All the Soc synthesis, implementation and simulation files are added in the GH Repository.

Description of all files:

1) Google Hackathon.ipynb - This file consist of pseudocode to measure average latency, throttling
frequency and average bandwidth from interface monitor outputs for
1000 samples using Python - Jupyter Notebooks.

2) heavy_transactions_1000_samples.csv - This is a csv file which consist of all samples. 
This file needs to be uploaded on Jupyter Notebooks along with 1st file to get desired outcomes.

3) project_1: You can open this folder and in that you will find project_1.xpr file which can be opened in AMD Vivado software to test the circuit synthesis,implementation & simulation.
